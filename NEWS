Changes in version 0.8:

API changes:
  New functions:
    LZ_decompress_reset
    LZ_decompress_sync_to_member
    LZ_decompress_write_size
    LZ_strerror

  Names and types for values of dictionary size limits have been changed
  to make interface names consistent.

  "LZ_errno" has been replaced with "LZ_Errno".

  "void *" has been replaced with "struct LZ_Encoder *" and
  "struct LZ_Decoder *" to make interface type safe.

A truncated member trailer is now correctly detected.

LZ_compress_restart_member is now able to restart a finished stream.

Lzlib now only accepts query or close operations after a fatal error has
occurred.

Shared version of lzlib is no more built by default. Use
"configure --enable-shared" to build it.

The "COPYING" file is no more used for testing decompression.
