Changes in version 1.15:

The targets 'lib' and 'bin' have been added to Makefile.in. 'lib' is the new
default and builds just the library. 'bin' builds both the library and
minilzip.

minilzip is no longer built by default.

'install-bin' installs minilzip and its man page again.

The use of the target 'bin' has been documented in INSTALL.
