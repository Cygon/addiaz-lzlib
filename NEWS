Changes in version 1.4:

Multi-step trials have been implemented.

Compression ratio has been slightly increased.

Compression time has been reduced by 8%.

Decompression time has been reduced by 7%.

Arguments and return values of functions in lzlib.h have been changed
from 'long long' to 'unsigned long long'.

The minimum size of the input compression buffer has been reduced to 64KiB.

"LZ_decompress_read" now tells "LZ_header_error" from "LZ_unexpected_eof"
the same way as lzip does when the EOF happens at the header.

The target "install-as-lzip" has been added to the Makefile.

The target "install-bin" has been added to the Makefile.
