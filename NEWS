Changes in version 1.0:

New functions:
  LZ_decompress_member_finished.
  LZ_decompress_member_version.
  LZ_decompress_dictionary_size.
  LZ_decompress_data_crc.

Variables declared "extern" have been encapsulated in a namespace.

A warning about fchown's return value being ignored has been fixed.

Input_buffer has been integrated in Range_decoder, simplifying the code
and making decompression slightly faster.
