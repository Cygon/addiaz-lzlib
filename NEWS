Changes in version 1.6:

Compression ratio of option -9 has been slightly increased.

The configure script now accepts the option "--disable-static".

Improved portability to BSD systems:

    The configure script now accepts the option "--disable-ldconfig".

    "make install" now ignores any errors from ldconfig.

Minilzip now copies file dates, permissions, and ownership like "cp -p".
(If the user ID or the group ID can't be duplicated, the file permission
bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID are cleared).

"lzlib.texinfo" has been renamed to "lzlib.texi".

The license has been changed to "GPL version 2 or later with link
exception".

Rationale for the license change.

I have recently been shocked to know that it is apparently not legal to
use lzlib in GPLv2 programs. Linking those programs with lzlib violates
the GPLv2. But linking proprietary programs with lzlib is fine and legal!

This problem is not caused by any fault in lzlib's link exception; the
LGPLv3 has the same problem. See for example
http://nmav.gnutls.org/2013/03/the-perils-of-lgplv3.html

Of course it was never my intention to prevent GPLv2 programs from using
lzlib. I'm sorry for any inconveniences my oversight may have caused to
distributions, GPLv2 software projects, and users in general.

I am also ashamed of having participated in this schism of the GPL
community. The mere proliferation of different free software licenses is
a burden in and of itself. From now on I'll license all my projects and
contributions in a way compatible with the GPLv2.
