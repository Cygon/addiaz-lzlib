Changes in version 1.1:

Compression time has been reduced by 2%.

All declarations not belonging to the API have been encapsulated in the
namespace "Lzlib".

New tests have been added to the testsuite.

Match length limits set by options -1 to -9 of minilzip have been
changed to match those of lzip 1.11.

Minilzip now sets stdin and stdout in binary mode on OS2.

The file bbexample.cc, containing example functions for buffer-to-buffer
compression/decompression, has been added.
