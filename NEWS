Changes in version 1.2:

For large values of "--match-length", compression ratio has been
slightly increased and compression time has been reduced by up to 6%.

The option "-F, --recompress", which forces recompression of files whose
name already has the ".lz" or ".tlz" suffix, has been added to minilzip.

"make install" no more tries to run "/sbin/ldconfig" on systems lacking
it.
