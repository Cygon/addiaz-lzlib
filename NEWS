Changes in version 1.3:

Lzlib has been translated to C from the C++ source of lzlib 1.2. This
has been done to avoid the dependency on libstdc++, making lzlib useful
in more environments.

Quote characters in messages have been changed as advised by GNU Coding
Standards.

Configure option "--datadir" has been renamed to "--datarootdir" to
follow GNU Standards.
