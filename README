Description

Lzlib is a data compression library providing in-memory LZMA compression
and decompression functions, including integrity checking of the
uncompressed data. The compressed data format used by the library is the
lzip format.

The functions and variables forming the interface of the compression
library are declared in the file lzlib.h. An usage example of the
library is given in the file main.cc.

Compression/decompression is done by repeteadly calling a couple of
read/write functions until all the data has been processed by the
library. This interface is safer and less error prone than the
traditional zlib interface.

Lzlib will correctly decompress a data stream which is the concatenation
of two or more compressed data streams. The result is the concatenation
of the corresponding uncompressed data streams. Integrity testing of
concatenated compressed data streams is also supported.

All the library functions are thread safe. The library does not install
any signal handler. The decoder checks the consistency of the compressed
data, so the library should never crash even in case of corrupted input.

Lzlib implements a simplified version of the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov
chain-Algorithm) algorithm. The original LZMA algorithm was designed by
Igor Pavlov. For a description of the LZMA algorithm, see the Lzip
manual.
